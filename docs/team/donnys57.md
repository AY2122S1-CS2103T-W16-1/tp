### Project: DonnaFin.io

DonnaFin.io is a desktop address book application used by financial advisors to keep track of their client information 
and related tasks. This is a Java program with about 10 kLoC with a JavaFX GUI.
The '.io' in our name is a reflection of our belief that you deserve a faster workflow for input and output.
If you can type fast, you can use our CLI-like commands to manage and view your notes, upcoming meetings and todo lists 
much faster than your typical customer relationship manager apps.
