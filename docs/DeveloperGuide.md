### 4.1 Architecture

<img alt="Architecture Diagram" src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img alt="Architecture Sequence Diagram" src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Here is an explanation of what takes place when the user enters the command `delete 1`
* The `UI` takes in the command inputted from the user and passes it to the `Logic` component that is responsible for parsing the input.
* The `Logic` component parses the command and the `deletePerson` method is called which engages the `Model` component.
* The `Model` component then deletes the `Person` object p from the `addressBook`.
* The `Logic` component then calls the `saveAddressBook` method to save the updated `addressBook` with the deleted person.
* The `Model` component then calls `saveAddressBook` method that engages the `Storage` component to save the updated changes to storage locally.

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img alt="Component Managers" src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 4.2 UI component

[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java) specifies the API of this component.

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel` in home view and `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, and `ClientPanel` in client view. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### 4.3 Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550" alt="Logic Class Diagram"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it chooses an `ABCParser` class e.g `AddressBookParser`, `ContactTabParser` etc., 
to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img alt="Parser Classes" src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>
<img alt="Parser Strategy" src="images/ParserStrategy.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* `ParserContext` holds a reference to a `ParserStrategy` that is set based on the current tab the user is on etc.
* When ParserContext calls upon the current ParserStrategy to parse a user command, the `ABCParser` (`ABC` is a placeholder for the specific parser strategy e.g.,`ContactTabParser`) creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` abstract class so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.
* `ClientViewParser` and `AddressBookParser` inherit from `ParserStrategy` while the tab specific parsers inherit from `ClientViewParser` inherit.


<img alt="SwitchTabExecution" src="images/SwitchTabExecutionSequenceDiagram.png" width="600"/>

How the `ABCParser` in ParserContext is updated:
1. When a `XYZCommand` class (e.g. `HomeCommand`, `ViewCommand`,...) is executed, it returns a `CommandResult` object containing a logic action if the `XYZCommand` requires a change in tab or view.
2. `LogicManager` accepts this `CommandResult` object and executes the logic action if present. `LogicManager` is a facade that is able to set and change the current `ParserStrategy`.
3. `ParserContext` in `LogicManager` is updated to contain the `ABCParser` of the new view or tab.


There is also another noteworthy Logic class, `PersonAdapter`, that serves as a wrapper for the Model class `Person`.
The key differences are that `Person` is immutable and does not support edits, while the `PersonAdapter` effectively supports edits by wrapping a single `Person` object and replacing it with an edited copy as and when necessary.
Such an implementation supports the user viewing and controlling a single client like with the `ViewCommand`.

### 4.4 Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img alt="Model Class Diagram" src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* stores `Storage` object and communicates with it to save address book to user files.

### 4.5 Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img alt="Storage Class Diagram" src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### 4.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `donnafin.commons` package.

## **7. Appendix: Requirements**

### 7.1 Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* Financial Advisor
* Has a need to manage a significant number of clients
  * Keep track of their financial and personal information
* Prefer desktop apps over other types
* Tech-savvy, comfortable with keyboard shortcuts (CLI apps)
* Can type fast
* Prefers typing to mouse interactions


**Value proposition**: manage customers faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app

The product provides financial advisors with a clean, easy to use interface to prepare
them for meetings and maintain good relationships with their clients. On a per-client basis,
DonnaFin keeps track and displays client’s financial details, their contact details, and
any notes about the client. In the main page, it collates all clients for easy access. In the
client information page, financial details of the specific client selected is neatly segmented into 
tabs for convenient and quick access.

The product will not help them with work relations with other Financial Advisors as the
product’s scope only covers the personal use of the product. It does not link with any
financial calculators, financial databases or cover market information.
