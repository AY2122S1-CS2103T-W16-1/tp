### 4.1 Architecture

<img alt="Architecture Diagram" src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above).
* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img alt="Component Managers" src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

#### 4.1.1 UI component

[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java) specifies the API of this component.

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel` in
home view and `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, and `ClientPanel` in client view. All these,
including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between
classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The UI that is displayed has 6 main tabs to switch between.
 1. `PERSON_LIST_PANEL`
 2. `CONTACT`
 3. `POLICIES`
 4. `ASSETS`
 5. `LIABILITIES`
 6. `NOTES`
 
 The first tab, `PERSON_LIST_PANEL` represents the home view of the client. It is where the user sees the information of multiple clients at the same time. The other 5 are tabs specific to
each client and will thus display different information for each client. The UI keeps track of the current tab it is
observing through the UiState, which is set on each tab switch command. Further details for the tab switch command can be found
[here](#-421-tab-switch-command).

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

#### 4.1.2 Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550" alt="Logic Class Diagram"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it chooses an `ABCParser` class e.g `AddressBookParser`, `ContactTabParser` etc.,
to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img alt="Parser Classes" src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* `ParserContext` holds a reference to a `ParserStrategy` that is set based on the current tab the user is on etc.
* When ParserContext calls upon the current ParserStrategy to parse a user command,
the `ABCParser` (`ABC` is a placeholder for the specific parser strategy e.g.,`ContactTabParser`) creates
an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the
other classes above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object. Further details can be seen in the
implementation of commands section [here](#421-command).


<img alt="Parser Strategy" src="images/ParserStrategy.png" width="600"/>
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` abstract class so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.
* `ClientViewParser` and `AddressBookParser` inherit from `ParserStrategy` while the tab specific parsers inherit from `ClientViewParser` inherit.


#### 4.1.3 Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img alt="Model Class Diagram" src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* stores `Storage` object and communicates with it to save address book to user files.

#### 4.1.4 Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img alt="Storage Class Diagram" src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

How is `Person` stored?
* `JsonAdaptedPerson` is created with Jackson.
* Each `Person` in DonnaFin is stored as a `JsonAdaptedPerson` as shown in our class diagram above.
* The name, email, phone number, address and notes of each `Person` is stored as a `JsonProperty` of type String.
* Assets, liabilities and policies are stored as a List of `JsonAdaptedAsset`, `JsonAdaptedLiability`
and `JsonAdaptedPolicy` respectively. Each `JsonAdaptedAsset`, `JsonAdaptedLiability`
and `JsonAdaptedPolicy` is created separately using Jackson and contains the necessary fields for their respective attributes, 
stored as a `JsonProperty` of type String.
* As a `Person` can have more than one `Asset`, `Liability` or `Policy`, we have chosen to store them as nested objects rather
converting them into a single String before storage and converting them back to the correct attributes on retrieval from the database.
* As such, `Asset`, `Liability` and `Policy` are stored in this special manner and any future attributes that share the same characteristics
can be stored in the same way.

Here is an example of a `Person` in JSON form:
``` yaml
{
  "name" : "Alex Yeoh",
  "phone" : "87438807",
  "email" : "alexyeoh@example.com",
  "address" : "Blk 30 Geylang Street 29, #06-40",
  "notes" : "Likes bread",
  "policies" : [ {
    "name" : "Golden Age",
    "insurer" : "AIA",
    "totalValueInsured" : "$ 14000.00",
    "yearlyPremiums" : "$ 28.00",
    "commission" : "$ 4.00"
  } ],
  "liabilities" : [ {
    "name" : "Bank debt",
    "type" : "debt",
    "value" : "$ 20000.00",
    "remarks" : "10% interest"
  } ],
  "assets" : [ {
    "name" : "HDB @Jurong",
    "type" : "Property",
    "value" : "$ 300000.00",
    "remarks" : "BTO"
  } ]
}
```

#### 4.1.5 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `donnafin.commons` package.

### 4.2 Implementation and Commands

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.
This will be a reference to explain the general flow of how the commands work later.

Command types fall into 3 main categories. 
1. Commands that involve organisation of clients.
2. Commands that involve editing of personal information of one specific client,
be it appending or removing information.
3. Commands that involve changing of tab

Despite falling under the three broad categories, the commands still have many similarities. Thus, we give an
in depth explanation of how the first category works. Subsequent explanation of commands from the other 2 categories will follow
the same framework but differ slightly.

#### 4.2.1 Commands that involve organisation of clients

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Key properties:** 
<br>
1. The command interacts with model through an addition or deletion<br>
2. The command interacts with storage through an addition or deletion.<br>
3. The command does not access the inner details of clients but rather treat them as atomic.
<br>
<br>
Commands that fall under this category are :<br>
1. Add <br>
2. Delete <br>
</div>

The delete command is one of the commands that fall under this category.
We will be using the `Delete` command as the example to illustrate and explain all commands under this category.

| Full sequence diagram  | 
|<img alt="Architecture Sequence Diagram" src="images/DeleteSequenceDiagramUiPart.png" width="800" /> |
| Logic specific sequence diagram |
|<img alt="Architecture Sequence Diagram" src="images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png" width="1200" /> |

Here is an explanation of what takes place when the user enters the command `delete 1` which falls under first [category](#42-implementation-and-commands).
The full sequence diagram gives the overview of what happens when a command runs. Since the main legwork is done
in logic, the logic specific sequence diagram as shown above takes a deeper dive into the inner details the full
sequence diagram.

From the diagram above:
* The `UI` takes in the command inputted from the user and passes it to the `Logic` component.
* The `Logic` component parses the command and returns the `Delete` command.
* The `Logic` component executes the `Delete` command. The `deletePerson` method in `Model` is called which engages the `Model` component.
* The `Model` component then deletes the `Person` object p from the `addressBook`.
* The `Logic` component then accepts the LogicConsumer produced from the command result. This consumer will alter the logic component depending on the command result. In this case, for the `delete` command, the consumer makes no change to logic.
* The `Logic` component then continues with the `execute` command and calls the `saveAddressBook` method to save the updated `addressBook` with the deleted person.
This does not involve a consumer in any way but is always part of execute command.
* The `Model` component then calls `saveAddressBook` method that engages the `Storage` component to save the updated changes to storage locally.
* The `UI` component then accepts the UiConsumer produced from the command result. This consumer will alter the UI component depending on the command result. In this case, for the `delete` command, the consumer makes no change to logic.

#### 4.2.2 Commands that accesses one specific client's information

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Key Properties:** 
<br>
<br>
The key differences are:<br>
1. The command has to access and edit information regarding one specific client.<br>
2. The command interacts and actively updates information in storage.
However, commands in the third category differ from the first in that change information of one specific client,
while the first adds/deletes the client specified.
<br>
<br>
Commands that fall into the second category are:<br>
1. Edit<br>
2. Append<br>
3. Remove<br>
</div>

Edit command is a command that edits the information of a specific client. Other commands like append and remove,
also deal directly with a specific client's information. Thus they fall under the second [category](#42-implementation-and-commands)
Like other commands in the other 2 [categories](#42-implementation-and-commands), edit command follows the same general
structure. We will be using the `Edit` command as the example to illustrate and explain all commands under this category.

From the diagram above:
* The `UI` takes in the command inputted from the user and passes it to the `Logic` component.
* The `Logic` component parses the input and the `Edit` command is returned. **A consumer for `PersonAdapter` is created here.**
* The `Logic` component executes the `Edit` command.
* During the execution of the `Edit` command above, the `PersonAdapter` accepts the consumer that edits
the specified person.
* A `EditCommandResult` is returned from the execution of `Edit` Command. This command result,
like the 2 other [categories](#42-implementation-and-commands) contain both a consumer for `UI` and `Logic`.
* The `Logic` component then accepts the LogicConsumer produced from the command result.
* The `UI` component then accepts the UiConsumer produced from the command result. **The `UI` is here to display the newly
edits made**.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">**Explanation of `PersonAdapter`:**
<br>
In this category of commands, the class`PersonAdapter` is doing most of the legwork here.
`PersonAdpater` serves as a wrapper for the Model class `Person`.
The key differences are that `Person` is immutable and does not support edits, while the `PersonAdapter` effectively supports edits by wrapping a single `Person` object and replacing it with an edited copy as and when necessary.
Such an implementation supports the user viewing and controlling a single client like with the `ViewCommand`.
</div>

#### 4.2.3 Commands that involve changing of tabs

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Key Properties:** 
<br>
The key differences are:<br>
1. The commands do not interact with model.<br>
2. The commands have to handle the changing of ParserStrategy, from the current one<br>
to `ABCParser` of the new tab.
3. The commands need to update the `UiState` of `Ui` to keep track of which tab the user is currently on.
<br>
<br>
Commands that fall into this category are:<br>
1. SwitchTab<br>
2. View<br>
</div>

Switch tab command is a command that explicitly involves the changing of tabs, which fall under the second [category](#42-implementation-and-commands)
We will be using the `SwitchTab` command as the example to illustrate and explain all commands under this category.

<img alt="SwitchTabExecution" src="images/SwitchTabExecutionSequenceDiagram.png" width="600"/>

As seen from the diagram above, the command logic is very similar to commands in the first [category](#421-commands-that-affect-model-and-storage)

* The `UI` takes in the command inputted from the user and passes it to the `Logic` component that is responsible for parsing the input.
* The `Logic` component parses the command and returns the `SwitchTab` command.
* The `Logic` component executes the `SwitchTab` command and returns the `SwitchTabCommandResult`
* The `Logic` component then accepts the LogicConsumer produced from the `SwitchTabCommandResult`.
In this case, for the `SwitchTab` command, a new `ParserStrategy` is set here. 
* The `UI` component then accepts the UiConsumer produced from the command result. UiState is set here. 


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">**Explanation of ParserContext:**
<br>
1. When a `XYZCommand` class (e.g. `HomeCommand`, `ViewCommand`,...) is executed, it returns a `CommandResult` object containing a logic action if the `XYZCommand` requires a change in tab or view. 
2. `LogicManager` accepts this `CommandResult` object and executes the logic action here.`LogicManager` is a facade that is able to set and change the current `ParserStrategy`.
3. `ParserContext` in `LogicManager` is updated to contain the `ABCParser` of the new view or tab.
4. `UI` is updated to change its state, which is kept track of by `UiState` by accepting the consumer also in the command result.
</div>

#### 4.3 NotesTab

The notes tab is different from the commands above. Instead of being command-based, the notes tab allows the user
to type in any quick notes that the user would want. Updating it in realtime. This is opposed to the commands where,
changes to any other component only happen when the command is executed. Hence the notes tab take advantage of a
different process.

Key features about notes:
1. A listener is attached to the `TextArea` of the notes tab. This allows for realtime updates
when typing in the `TextArea`. When there any changes, the function `edit` in `PersonAdapter` is called.
2. The `edit` function in `PersonAdapter` saves the information straight away, hence making the updates realtime.

## 6. Appendix: Requirements

### 6.1 Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* Financial Advisor
* Has a need to manage a significant number of clients
  * Keep track of their financial and personal information
* Prefer desktop apps over other types
* Tech-savvy, comfortable with keyboard shortcuts (CLI apps)
* Can type fast
* Prefers typing to mouse interactions


**Value proposition**: manage customers faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app

The product provides financial advisors with a clean, easy to use interface to prepare
them for meetings and maintain good relationships with their clients. On a per-client basis,
DonnaFin keeps track and displays clientâ€™s financial details, their contact details, and
any notes about the client. In the main page, it collates all clients for easy access. In the
client information page, financial details of the specific client selected is neatly segmented into
tabs for convenient and quick access.

The product will not help them with work relations with other Financial Advisors as the
productâ€™s scope only covers the personal use of the product. It does not link with any
financial calculators, financial databases or cover market information.
